# --- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---

You can find the original problem statement here: [https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

The problem is split into two parts.

Part 1: The Elves are on an expedition in the jungle and they are keeping track of the calories they bring with them. The Elves are writing the number of calories per food item they are carrying, one item per line. Each elf is separating their inventory from the previous elf's inventory with a blank line. The task is to find the total number of calories that the elf carrying the most calories is carrying.

Part 2: The Elves have realized that if they rely only on the elf carrying the most calories, they might run out of snacks. Therefore, they want to know the total calories carried by the top three elves carrying the most calories. This way, even if one of them runs out of snacks, they will still have two backups. The task is to find the sum of the calories carried by these three elves with the most calories.

In both parts, you are expected to read the input, which is a list of integers, where each group of integers separated by blank lines representing the food items carried by each elf. And based on that input you are expected to find the sum of total calories carried by the top elf or top three elves and return that result.
