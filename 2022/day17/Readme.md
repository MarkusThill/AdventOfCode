You can find the original problem statement here: [https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17)

Part 1:

The problem describes a scenario where a person is in a cave with elephants and needs to find an alternative exit. The ground is rumbling and rocks are falling from above, and the person has to figure out where the rocks will fall next to avoid being crushed. The rocks come in five different shapes, and fall in a specific order, with the order repeating once the end of the list is reached. The rocks also get pushed around by jets of hot gas coming out of the walls, and the pattern of these jets is given. The chamber is seven units wide, and each rock appears so that its left edge is two units away from the left wall and its bottom edge is three units above the highest rock in the room. After 2022 rocks have stopped falling, the person needs to know how tall the tower of rocks will be.

Part 2:

The elephants are not satisfied with the simulation and want to know how tall the tower of rocks will be after a large number of rocks (1000000000000) have stopped falling. The task is to determine the height of the tower after this many rocks have stopped.
